#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Dominic Brant]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Thursday, January 4th, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 (January 4th, 2018)
I spent a few minutes working on the "Advanced Topics" section of Codecademy's Python course. Today I learned about Python's comprehension syntax. At first it seems like a powerful way to use shorthand to accomplish something that otherwise would take multiple lines (like the spread/rest operator, arrow functions and other features of ES2015+).

### R1D2 (January 5th, 2018)
I finished Learn You Node. I enjoyed the workshop's concise instructions, which forced me to spent time to figure out the problem. While I had to copy off the solution in the repo (no shame), I learned a lot in a short amount of time.

I started How To NPM. I found the first the few exercises I nice test on using NPM, but I stopped once I felt that it was going over information I was already familiar.

I started my Random project, and make a lot of progress on it. It was my first time using the npm init command and working with a package.json. I feel very confident, and I'm looking forward to continue to tinker with Node.

### R1D3 (January 6th, 2018)
I read a few good articles on JavaScript. One was about async/await and promises. I also got my random CLI working as a global module. I might revisit it in the future and make some additions but for now I'm satisfied with the result

### R1D4 (January 7th, 2018)
I was a bit tired today and didn't have too much free time, but I managed to read a couple good articles from Sessionstack's Medium page. One on how V8 works, and the other on how Web Assembly works. Both were pretty high-concept topics for me, and some of it flew right over my head, but I still found them interesting. I'll definitely be paying close attention to how Web Assembly evolves as it gains more browser support.

### R1D5 (January 8th, 2018)
I finished the last few exercises on the "Advanced Topics" section of Codecademy's Python course. I learned lambda expressions, which seemed daunting at first but I was able to grasp them fairly quickly.

I finished testing out the font loading API. It's really useful, and easy to implement.

### R1D6 (January 9th, 2018)
I got some work done on the "Introduction to Bitwise Operators" section of Codecademy's Python course. Coding in binary seems scary but it doesn't take too long to get the number system down. I also read a couple articles, including MDN's Introduction to CSS Box Model. It felt good to brush up on the fundamentals of CSS.

### R1D7 (January 10th, 2018)
Did a light amount of coding today. Finished the "Introduction to Bitwise Operators" section of Codecademy's Python course.

### R1D8 (January 11th, 2018)
I started and my finished my module I wrote that checks if a string, array or object is empty. All the credit goes to Peter Piekarczyk for [tweeting the code out](https://twitter.com/peterpme/status/949352875687202816).

I made some more progress on Codecademy's Python course, learning about classes. It was fairly easy to pick up, not much that makes it different from the way classes work in Java or JavaScript.

Finally, I read a few good articles today. The one most worth mentioning would have to be FreeCodeCamp's [article on Node streams](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93). It was a lot of new information and I'll have to revisit it in the future to better understand it, but it was a valuable read.

### R1D9 (January 12th, 2018)
I had a busy morning, so I didn't get to do any coding today. I did get a chance to read a good article explaining how HTTP2/server push works.

### R1D10 (January 13th, 2018)
Another busy day. No coding unfortunately, but I did find the time to enjoy Traversy Media's [JSON Crash Course video](https://youtu.be/wI1CWzNtE-M). I always love watching one of his videos, and even though JSON seems like a shallow topic, it taught me a few things I didn't know before.

### R1D11 (January 14th, 2018)
Didn't get any coding into today. I did read Stephanie Drescher's ["Lint the Web Forward with Sonarwhal"](https://24ways.org/2017/lint-the-web-forward-with-sonarwhal/), which was  great.

### R1D12 (January 15th, 2018)
I finished the Codecademy Python course's introduction to classes. I also got started my Node battleship CLI. I had trouble handling taking multiple lines of input and then having the battle logic execute. I may have to enlist the help of a package that makes readline input synchronous.

### R1D13 (January 16th, 2018)
I didn't get any coding in today, but I read ["How did I land my first job as a self-taught developer? I prepared like crazy."](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-set-myself-up-to-land-my-first-job-as-a-self-taught-developer-43d326ea6b67)

### R1D14 (January 17th, 2018)
Didn't get to do any coding today either, but I read a great article titled [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to HTTP/2 and its Importance](https://www.advancedwebranking.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-http2/). It gave me the most clear understanding of HTTP/2 and its benefits I've gotten so far.

### R1D15 (January 18th, 2018)
I read a really comprehensive article on [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://24ways.org/2017/wcag-for-people-who-havent-read-them/), and I got a fair amount of coding in today. I spent some time working on my Node battleship command line game. I'm still having trouble getting the part of the program that asks for user input to repeat (without just copying and pasting my code multiple times), so I'm going to take a break from it. I'll revisit it in the future once I get a better understanding of Node.

Finally, I made another one-liner utility that filters duplicate values from an array. Big ups to Addy Osmani for [Tweeting the code](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/952805052086824960?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Em5%7Ctwgr%5Eemail%7Ctwcon%5E7046%7Ctwterm%5E1).

### R1D16 (January 19th, 2018)
Didn't get any coding done today, but I read [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-dropped-out-of-college-to-pursue-my-dreams-of-being-a-web-developer-and-designer-1abfecb44232) about a guy who left college to become a web developer. It was a fascinating story. He sounds very driven and of course, brilliant.

### R1D17 (January 20th, 2018)
Almost done with the Codecademy Python course. I finished another section on classes. It's nice getting more experience with OOP, even though Python's syntax feels a little odd compared to how classes work in JavaScript.

### R1D18 (January 21th, 2018)
I finished the Codecademy Python course. The last section was comprised of the fundamentals of I/O. I found it to be easy to pick up and learn, and it will serve useful if I ever work with a Python REST API.

### R1D19 (January 22nd, 2018)
I got some work done on my project to test out different ways of making HTTP requests in Node. I played around with the core http module, and I also tried Request.

### R1D20 (January 23rd, 2018)
Today I read CSS Tricks' [GraphQL guide for front end developers](https://css-tricks.com/front-end-developers-guide-graphql/). It was concise and informative. I have a much better understaning of GraphQL and how it works now.

### R1D21 (January 24th, 2018)
I finished my project of testing HTTP requests in Node. Now I'm going to try using Async/Await for the first time. I'm going to try it in both Node and the browser.

### R1D22 (January 25th, 2018)
I got a lot done today. I finished my project of testing Async/Await in both Node and the browser. It's a great new addition to JavaScript. I'll definitely be taking advantage of it going forward.

### R1D23 (January 26th, 2018)
Missed today. Got no coding in. No excuses, time to get it done these next few days and strengthen my habit of coding daily.

### R1D24 (January 27th, 2018)
Today I read Lee Robinson's [How Stripe Designs Beautiful Websites](https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/). It was a quick yet layered breakdown of the things big and small a wesbite like Stripe's homepage does.

### R1D25 (January 28th, 2018)
Today I read Rachel Andrew's [article on testing for the web](https://24ways.org/2017/testing-the-web-platform/?utm_content=buffer668e3&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).

### R1D26 (January 29th, 2018)
I got about halfway through Node School's Stream Adventure workshop. Looking forward to completing it this week.

### R1D27 (January 30th, 2018)
Made a lot of progress today. I finished Node School's Stream Adventure (well I didn't finish it, I decided to shelve it for now, as I plan on doing some reading up on streams first).

I also played around with making a static file server using Node's http module. It worked (kinda) but it took a lot longer than I anticipated. I finally decided to give it a go in Express, and that was much easier. I can see why Express is popular!

### R1D28 (January 31st, 2018)
Another day with a lot of progress. I finished my Express server, and I got to play with Browser Sync and Live Server for using live reload. I also used Boxen and Chalk to stylize the messages my server logs to the command line.

### R1D29 (February 1st, 2018)
Today I read the [Stream Handbook GitHub Repo](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook).

### R1D30 (February 2nd, 2018)

Today I read [this great article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-went-from-programming-with-a-feature-phone-to-working-for-an-mit-startup-40ca3be4fa0f) about a young man in Africa who started programming from a feature phone. It taught me quite a few things. First, there are many people in the world who do not have access to some of the things I have in my life (high speed internet, a fast computer, a smartphone) that make programming easier. Second, there is always a way to accomplish your goals in programming, it's just about how hard you're willing to work to get it done.

### R1D31 (February 3rd, 2018)
Today I started trying out Gulp as a build tool. I didn't make a lot of progress, but I did a lot of work getting things set up. I learned along the way some ways to troubleshoot various issues of modules not being found and similar errors. Looking forward to learning more about it how Gulp works and what it can do.

### R1D32 (February 4th, 2018)
I made more progress in testing out Gulp today. I got some PostCSS plugins working, as well strip-debug and uglify-es for Javascript. Using the parallel function in Gulp 4 is nice.

### R1D33 (February 5th, 2018)
Today I did so more work with Gulp. That consisted of getting the sourcemaps plugin working. I also separated my css into two files: `Reset.css` and `Style.css`. Later on I plan to use the concat plugin to merge files such as these together.

### R1D34 (February 6th, 2018)
Today I read [I just asked 23,000 developers what they think of JavaScript.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-asked-23-000-developers-what-they-think-of-javascript-heres-what-i-learned-9a06b61998fa). It was a good article, it gives a perspective on how many different areas of interest there are within web development.

### R1D35 (February 7th, 2018)
Today I did some work with Gulp. Today I tried using the concat plugin to merge CSS and JS files. I also got the gulp.watch function working, which seems like it will prove to be really useful.

### R1D36 (February 8th, 2018)
Today I made some more progress on learning Gulp. I got the html-replace plugin working to have my build create a new html file that links to my CSS and JavaScript build files.

### R1D37 (February 9th, 2018)
Today I read [5 GitHub Tips for New Coders](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/5-github-tips-for-new-coders-2f312689ffd5).

### R1D38 (February 10th, 2018)
Today I listend to the [JavaScript Tooling](https://syntax.fm/show/004/javascript-tooling) episode of Syntax FM. It was a great episode of one of my favorite web development podcasts.

### R1D39 (February 11th, 2018)
Today I read [Announcing CodeSandbox 2.0](https://hackernoon.com/announcing-codesandbox-2-0-938cff3a0fcb). I just heard of CodeSandbox for the first time this week, and it sounds really cool and full of some great features. I'll be keeping a close eye on it to see how it grows and matures.

### R1D40 (February 12th, 2018)
Today I got some more work done with Gulp. I tested using live-server while my Gulp file watches for changes in my HTML, CSS or JavaScript. I only have a few more plugins left to test out.

### R1D41 (February 13th, 2018)
Today I did some more work with Gulp. I spend most of my time working on setting up a function to display the size of my Index.html and its CSS and JS files. It was harder than I anticipated. I ended up making a custom solution using the fs module's stat function.

### R1D42 (February 14th, 2018)
Today I finished my gulp test project. The last plugin I tested was gulp-responsive to generate different sizes of images. It was really powerful, but I'm not sure how much I'll need it for my projects given that I don't handle a large number of images. I've got to say, I really like gulp, and I'll be using it a lot in the future.

### R1D43 (February 15th, 2018)
Today I read [Lessons from 7 self-taught coders](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/inspirational-success-stories-from-self-taught-web-developers-4f6f375cf17d). It was cool to see some stories from different people, and how there is overlap in much of what they went through to get into the tech industry.

### R1D44 (February 16th, 2018)
Today I started playing with Babel. This is really exciting because I've read a lot about it, and getting off the ground wasn't too hard. Next up, I'll be integreating it into my Gulp build.

### R1D45 (February 17th, 2018)
Today I finished my test project for Babel using the gulp-babel plugin. I got some basic transpilation with preset-env. I also got a .babelrc.js file working too. Looking forward to using this in the future.

### R1D46 (February 18th, 2018)
Today I didn't get any coding in. I'm looking forward to trying out Prepack tomorrow however.

### R1D47 (February 19th, 2018)
Today I spent some time trying out Prepack. I tried the online REPL and then the CLI. It's a really exciting concept, and hopefully I'll find ways to incorporate it into the builds of my future projects.

### R1D48 (February 20th, 2018)
Today I read [Node Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide). It's a quick read of general best practices for writing Node.js code.

### R1D49 (February 21st, 2018)
Today I watched and coded along to the first 20 minutes of Brad Traversy's [AJAX Crash Course](https://youtu.be/82hnvUYY6QA). I learned about how an AJAX goes through five different state changes when a request is made.

### R1D50 (February 22nd, 2018)
50 days! I'm halfway there! Today I made some progress on Brad Traversy's [AJAX Crash Course](https://youtu.be/82hnvUYY6QA). I finished the part using the GitHub API, which felt really cool even though it was very simple. The last part of the video is about working with a PHP file. I plan on watching the rest but I'm not sure if I'm going to code along to it.

### R1D51 (February 23rd, 2018)
Today I listened to [episode 30](http://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/static-site-generators-and-dynamic-drink-drinkers/) of the Front End Happy Hour podcast. It was really entertaining and informative. After listening I think I'm going to make a project to build a static site generator in Node.js in the near future.

### R1D52 (February 24th, 2018)
Today I finished Brad Traversy's AJAX Crash Course video, and I also started and finished his [Fetch API Introduction](https://youtu.be/Oive66jrwBs) video. The Fetch API video was really fun to do, because it was my first time submitting a post request. The Fetch API makes it pretty simple.

### R1D53 (February 25th, 2018)
Today I got a few small projects done. I tested a project of making a release in GitHub using Git tags. I also got my portfolio's 'coming soon' page working in Firefox (it was a simple fix with the margin-top for the first element in the container. I also coded along to Brandon Morelli's articles on [map, filter, reduce and chaining all three](https://codeburst.io/javascript-learn-to-chain-map-filter-and-reduce-acd2d0562cd4). It was a really fun exercise.

Lastly, I got some of things in place to get started on v1.0 of my portfolio.

### R1D54 (February 26th, 2018)
I got Emmet set up for Atom and Sublime. It's so cool how fast it is to type out things that are normally complex. I also started making some edits to the photos I'm considering using for the main banner image on my portfolio.

### R1D55 (February 27th, 2018)
I got a lot of the structure set up for my portfolio. I also got all of the potential banner images desinged. Looking forward to getting into the coding soon.

### R1D56 (February 28th, 2018)
Today I got a couple of snippets set up in Atom and Sublime. One for declaring a basic HTML document, and another for my custom CSS reset. I also got my portfolio page with a banner image set up. Next up, I'll be designing the header.

### R1D57 (March 1st, 2018)
I missed getting any coding done today. I'm gonna focus on finding of some time to work on my portfolio this weekend.

### R1D58 (March 2nd, 2018)
Another missed day. I'll be able to get some coding in this weekend.

### R1D59 (March 3rd, 2018)
Today I read [this article on closures](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/whats-a-javascript-closure-in-plain-english-please-6a1fc1d2ff1c). It helped me better understand that closures and scope are closely related. In fact, closures seem to be the act of ultilizing different scopes within a function or functions.

### R1D60 (March 4th, 2018)
Today I got the header for my portfolio site started. Next up, I'll be working on the sections below.

### R1D61 (March 5th, 2018)
Today I missed getting any coding in today. Looking forward to working on my portfolio tomorrow.

### R1D62 (March 6th, 2018)
Today I got the main sections for my portfolio page laid out. One of them has a gradient background, and I'm planning on implementing that for another.

### R1D63 (March 18th, 2018)
After taking the last week and a half off because I was on vacation, I was happy to get back into coding today. I got the 'learn more' button on my portfolio website working.

### R1D64 (March 19th, 2018)
Today I put the finishing touches on the 'learn more' button on my portfolio website. I also got the header's positioning working.

### R1D65 (March 20th, 2018)
Today I got a little bit more work done on my portfolio website. I picked out the gradient backgrounds for the four main sections.

### R1D66 (March 21st, 2018)
Today I listened to [episode 20](https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/ep-20-machine-learning-in-tensorflow-an-interview-with-nishant-shukla) of the FreeCodeCamp podcast about machine learning. It was really informative given my lack of experience in programming with maching learning tools such as TensorFlow.

### R1D67 (March 22nd, 2018)
Today I read [JavaScript type coercion explained](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/js-type-coercion-explained-27ba3d9a2839).

### R1D68 (March 23rd, 2018)
Today I got the header animation working on my portfolio website for desktop users.

### R1D69 (March 24th, 2018)
Today I listened to [episode 35 ](http://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/top-shelf-style-guides/) of the Front End Happy Hour podcast.

### R1D70 (March 25th, 2018)
Today I got the animation working that makes the buttons in the header in my portfolio website scroll down to a correspoding section of the page. I also got it working for using tab to navigate the buttons and enter to trigger the animation.

### R1D71 (March 26th, 2018)
Today I read [this article](http://www.monitis.com/blog/cc-in-review-the-key-differences-between-sql-and-nosql-dbs/) on the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases. It was a good read given that I have yet to start working with databases in my projects.

### R1D72 (March 27th, 2018)
Today I got the nav of my portfolio website working on mobile. It was much easier than I was anticipating.
