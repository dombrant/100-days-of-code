# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Dominic Brant]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Thursday, January 4th, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 (January 4th, 2018) 
I spent a few minutes working on the "Advanced Topics" section of Codecademy's Python course. Today I learned about Python's comprehension syntax. At first it seems like a powerful way to use shorthand to accomplish something that otherwise would take multiple lines (like the spread/rest operator, arrow functions and other features of ES2015+).

### R1D2 (January 5th, 2018) 
I finished Learn You Node. I enjoyed the workshop's concise instructions, which forced me to spent time to figure out the problem. While I had to copy off the solution in the repo (no shame), I learned a lot in a short amount of time.

I started How To NPM. I found the first the few exercises I nice test on using NPM, but I stopped once I felt that it was going over information I was already familiar.

I started my Random project, and make a lot of progress on it. It was my first time using the npm init command and working with a package.json. I feel very confident, and I'm looking forward to continue to tinker with Node.

### R1D3 (January 6th, 2018) 
I read a few good articles on JavaScript. One was about async/await and promises. I also got my random CLI working as a global module. I might revisit it in the future and make some additions but for now I'm satisfied with the result 

### R1D4 (January 7th, 2018)
I was a bit tired today and didn't have too much free time, but I managed to read a couple good articles from Sessionstack's Medium page. One on how V8 works, and the other on how Web Assembly works. Both were pretty high-concept topics for me, and some of it flew right over my head, but I still found them interesting. I'll definitely be paying close attention to how Web Assembly evolves as it gains more browser support.

### R1D5 (January 8th, 2018)
I finished the last few exercises on the "Advanced Topics" section of Codecademy's Python course. I learned lambda expressions, which seemed daunting at first but I was able to grasp them fairly quickly.

I finished testing out the font loading API. It's really useful, and easy to implement.

### R1D6 (January 9th, 2018)
I got some work done on the "Introduction to Bitwise Operators" section of Codecademy's Python course. Coding in binary seems scary but it doesn't take too long to get the number system down. I also read a couple articles, including MDN's Introduction to CSS Box Model. It felt good to brush up on the fundamentals of CSS.

### R1D7 (January 10th, 2018)
Did a light amount of coding today. Finished the "Introduction to Bitwise Operators" section of Codecademy's Python course.

### R1D8 (January 11th, 2018)
I started and my finished my module I wrote that checks if a string, array or object is empty. All the credit goes to Peter Piekarczyk for [tweeting the code out](https://twitter.com/peterpme/status/949352875687202816).

I made some more progress on Codecademy's Python course, learning about classes. It was fairly easy to pick up, not much that makes it different from the way classes work in Java or JavaScript.

Finally, I read a few good articles today. The one most worth mentioning would have to be FreeCodeCamp's [article on Node streams](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93). It was a lot of new information and I'll have to revisit it in the future to better understand it, but it was a valuable read.

### R1D9 (January 12th, 2018)
I had a busy morning, so I didn't get to do any coding today. I did get a chance to read a good article explaining how HTTP2/server push works.

### R1D10 (January 13th, 2018)
Another busy day. No coding unfortunately, but I did find the time to enjoy Traversy Media's [JSON Crash Course video](https://youtu.be/wI1CWzNtE-M). I always love watching one of his videos, and even though JSON seems like a shallow topic, it taught me a few things I didn't know before.

### R1D11 (January 14th, 2018)
Didn't get any coding into today. I did read Stephanie Drescher's ["Lint the Web Forward with Sonarwhal"](https://24ways.org/2017/lint-the-web-forward-with-sonarwhal/), which was  great.

### R1D12 (January 15th, 2018)
I finished the Codecademy Python course's introduction to classes. I also got started my Node battleship CLI. I had trouble handling taking multiple lines of input and then having the battle logic execute. I may have to enlist the help of a package that makes readline input synchronous.

### R1D13 (January 16th, 2018)
I didn't get any coding in today, but I read ["How did I land my first job as a self-taught developer? I prepared like crazy."](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-set-myself-up-to-land-my-first-job-as-a-self-taught-developer-43d326ea6b67)

### R1D14 (January 17th, 2018)
Didn't get to do any coding today either, but I read a great article titled [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to HTTP/2 and its Importance](https://www.advancedwebranking.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-http2/). It gave me the most clear understanding of HTTP/2 and its benefits I've gotten so far.

### R1D15 (January 18th, 2018)
I read a really comprehensive article on [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://24ways.org/2017/wcag-for-people-who-havent-read-them/), and I got a fair amount of coding in today. I spent some time working on my Node battleship command line game. I'm still having trouble getting the part of the program that asks for user input to repeat (without just copying and pasting my code multiple times), so I'm going to take a break from it. I'll revisit it in the future once I get a better understanding of Node.

Finally, I made another one-liner utility that filters duplicate values from an array. Big ups to Addy Osmani for [Tweeting the code](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/952805052086824960?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Em5%7Ctwgr%5Eemail%7Ctwcon%5E7046%7Ctwterm%5E1).

### R1D16 (January 19th, 2018)
Didn't get any coding done today, but I read [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-dropped-out-of-college-to-pursue-my-dreams-of-being-a-web-developer-and-designer-1abfecb44232) about a guy who left college to become a web developer. It was a fascinating story. He sounds very driven and of course, brilliant.

### R1D17 (January 20th, 2018)
Almost done with the Codecademy Python course. I finished another section on classes. It's nice getting more experience with OOP, even though Python's syntax feels a little odd compared to how classes work in JavaScript.

### R1D18 (January 21th, 2018)
I finished the Codecademy Python course. The last section was comprised of the fundamentals of I/O. I found it to be easy to pick up and learn, and it will serve useful if I ever work with a Python REST API.

### R1D19 (January 22nd, 2018)
I got some work done on my project to test out different ways of making HTTP requests in Node. I played around with the core http module, and I also tried Request.
