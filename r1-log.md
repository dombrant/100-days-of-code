# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Dominic Brant]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Thursday, January 4th, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 (January 4th, 2018) 
I spent a few minutes working on the "Advanced Topics" section of Codecademy's Python course. Today I learned about Python's comprehension syntax. At first it seems like a powerful way to use shorthand to accomplish something that otherwise would take multiple lines (like the spread/rest operator, arrow functions and other features of ES2015+).

### R1D2 (January 5th, 2018) 
I finished Learn You Node. I enjoyed the workshop's concise instructions, which forced me to spent time to figure out the problem. While I had to copy off the solution in the repo (no shame), I learned a lot in a short amount of time.

I started How To NPM. I found the first the few exercises I nice test on using NPM, but I stopped once I felt that it was going over information I was already familiar.

I started my Random project, and make a lot of progress on it. It was my first time using the npm init command and working with a package.json. I feel very confident, and I'm looking forward to continue to tinker with Node.

### R1D3 (January 6th, 2018) 
I read a few good articles on JavaScript. One was about async/await and promises. I also got my random CLI working as a global module. I might revisit it in the future and make some additions but for now I'm satisfied with the result 

### R1D4 (January 7th, 2018)
I was a bit tired today and didn't have too much free time, but I managed to read a couple good articles from Sessionstack's Medium page. One on how V8 works, and the other on how Web Assembly works. Both were pretty high-concept topics for me, and some of it flew right over my head, but I still found them interesting. I'll definitely be paying close attention to how Web Assembly evolves as it gains more browser support.

### R1D5 (January 8th, 2018)
I finished the last few exercises on the "Advanced Topics" section of Codecademy's Python course. I learned lambda expressions, which seemed daunting at first but I was able to grasp them fairly quickly.

I finished testing out the font loading API. It's really useful, and easy to implement.

### R1D6 (January 9th, 2018)
I got some work done on the "Introduction to Bitwise Operators" section of Codecademy's Python course. Coding in binary seems scary but it doesn't take too long to get the number system down. I also read a couple articles, including MDN's Introduction to CSS Box Model. It felt good to brush up on the fundamentals of CSS.

### R1D7 (January 10th, 2018)
Did a light amount of coding today. Finished the "Introduction to Bitwise Operators" section of Codecademy's Python course.

### R1D8 (January 11th, 2018)
I started and my finished my module I wrote that checks if a string, array or object is empty. All the credit goes to Peter Piekarczyk for [tweeting the code out](https://twitter.com/peterpme/status/949352875687202816).

I made some more progress on Codecademy's Python course, learning about classes. It was fairly easy to pick up, not much that makes it different from the way classes work in Java or JavaScript.

Finally, I read a few good articles today. The one most worth mentioning would have to be FreeCodeCamp's [article on Node streams](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93). It was a lot of new information and I'll have to revisit it in the future to better understand it, but it was a valuable read.
