# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Thursday, January 4th, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 (January 4th, 2018) 
I spent a few minutes working on the "Advanced Topics" section of Codecademy's Python course. Today I learned about Python's comprehension syntax. At first it seems like a powerful way to use shorthand to accomplish something that otherwise would take multiple lines (like the spread/rest operator, arrow functions and other features of ES2015+).

### R1D2 (January 5th, 2018) 
I finished Learn You Node. I enjoyed the workshop's concise instructions, which forced me to spent time to figure out the problem. While I had to copy off the solution in the repo (no shame), I learned a lot in a short amount of time.

I started How To NPM. I found the first the few exercises I nice test on using NPM, but I stopped once I felt that it was going over information I was already familiar.

I started my Random project, and make a lot of progress on it. It was my first time using the npm init command and working with a package.json. I feel very confident, and I'm looking forward to continue to tinker with Node.
